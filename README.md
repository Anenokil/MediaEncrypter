# Media Encrypter
The program can encrypt and decrypt images, gifs and videos

## How it works
Before starting encryption/decryption you must enter a key that you came up with<br>
The key can include `latin letters`, `numbers`, `-` and `_`<br>
The key must have a **certain length** (it is specified in the program)<br>
You can also test the program using a test key (it is specified in the program too)<br>
To decrypt a file you must enter the **same key** that you entered when encrypting<br>
